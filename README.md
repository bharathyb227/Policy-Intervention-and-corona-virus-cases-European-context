I worked on the creation of a project by Insights Analytic. The analysis and graphical representations were my responsibility, and I accomplished this by using Matplotlib and ggplot2. In my previous role, I helped with the ETL process and exploratory data analysis. My primary responsibilities include writing code in Python and R and publicizing the results. I also did statistical analysis, including data distributions, to back up the results.
The origin tool is used to choose suitable data representation techniques.
Doing analysis on ML techniques and putting them to use in the Jupyter Notebook and R programming environments. An additional 23% in accuracy has been added to the model.
